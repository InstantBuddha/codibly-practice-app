Live demo on [Netlify](https://stately-frangipane-d6782b.netlify.app/)

## Task Requirements
- Use an API endpoint to display a paginated list of products
- At the top of the view, there is a text input, which allows the user to filter results by id. The input accepts only numbers, other characters don't even appear
- Below this input the user can see a table displaying the following items’ properties: id, name, and year
- Additionally, the background colour of each row is taken from the colour property
- Pagination is fixed to 5 items per page
- Under the table, is a pagination component, which allows switching between pages with “next” and “previous” arrows
